// ==========================================
// AUTHENTICATION - EMAIL/PASSWORD ONLY
// ==========================================

// Note: Social media authentication (Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter) 
// and phone authentication have been removed for simplicity.
// Only email/password authentication is now supported.

// Auth state is handled in script.js via auth.onAuthStateChanged()

// All authentication event listeners are handled in script.js
// This file is kept for compatibility but can be removed if desired
