                    <h4>Q: Can I use the same email to create a new account?</h4>
                    <p>A: Yes, after deletion, you can create a new account with the same email, but it will be a completely new account with no previous data.</p>

                    <h4>Q: Will deleting my TENSURA account also delete my Google/Facebook account?</h4>
                    <p>A: No. Deleting your TENSURA account only removes data from our platform. Your social media accounts remain unaffected.</p>
